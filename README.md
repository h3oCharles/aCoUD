# status

on Friday, 13th December, 2024, I broke my drive due to stress from upgrading to a new one. basically, i lost progress. there's the entire repo, sure, but everything else surrounding it got lost, including other projects, which also includes my motivation to continue. not only my motivation is on a low, but so is my patience. the way I'm trying to code this (which includes multiple scripts being loaded on top of each mission) makes everything so inconsistent I cannot fathom what's going on, and I cannot accept copy-pasting every repeating piece of code into a mission manually.

i am putting this on an indefinite hiatus until someone has the patience to help me figure this out. this isn't a LuaAPI problem, this is a programming problem. shouldn't i be able to do it? i need someone to tell me that what I'm seeing makes sense (or not lol), and morally help me figure this out, whether it's workflow, code methodology, or whatever.

# A Collection of Unimaginative Dreams

This is _**A Collection of Unimaginative Dreams**_, a campaign for [Hedgewars](https://www.hedgewars.org/).

Drawn into a world of dreams, you find yourself exploring a series of surreal landscapes that reflect the tangled threads of creativity and burnout.

Across from you sits a quiet hedgehog, a reflection of my own creative struggles, reading from an open book. In a soft, soothing voice, the hedgehog unravels the mysteries of the subconscious, each word drifting through the air like a warm, heavy blanket. Gradually, the boundaries of reality and dream dissolve, and as the scene fades to black, you feel yourself slipping into the depths of these imagined worlds.

As you navigate these dreams, you’ll confront the limitations of imagination, wrestle with the weight of expectation, and uncover hidden depths within the seemingly ordinary. This journey is more than a series of battles; it is a glimpse into the creative process, a celebration of perseverance, and a reminder—for me and for all—that even in moments of burnout, stories are still waiting to be told.

# About

this will be a code dump for a campaign for [Hedgewars](https://www.hedgewars.org/) to showcase the potential of this game, and my capabilities

you're mainly interested in Missions/Campaign/A_Collection_of_Unimaginative_Dreams and Maps, as Missions/Training and Scripts/Multiplayer are tech demos of individual functions without any instructions

for the campaign's internal scripts, check out the [repo's wiki](https://github.com/h3oCharles/aCoUD/wiki) 

I am not even close to finishing this, so for now, check out the [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15tYcsRryqzY5E5rcbczyLtZuXW3SZyQzfwme-BqET2M/edit?usp=sharing) of what's about to come of this

# Installation

to make it work in-game, download the code as a ZIP file and extract it to reveal an "aCoUD-main" folder. Open it, select all contents, package it as a ZIP file, rename the extension to HWP, and [put it in your data folder](https://www.hedgewars.org/node/6761)

# Contributing

if anyone would like to contribute, please read [the knowledge base](https://www.hedgewars.org/kb/LuaAPI) and the [repo's wiki](https://github.com/h3oCharles/aCoUD/wiki) first before contacting me
