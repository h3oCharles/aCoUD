# A Collection of Unimaginative Dreams

This is _**A Collection of Unimaginative Dreams**_, a campaign for [Hedgewars](https://www.hedgewars.org/).

Drawn into a world of dreams, you find yourself exploring a series of surreal landscapes that reflect the tangled threads of creativity and burnout.

Across from you sits a quiet hedgehog, a reflection of my own creative struggles, reading from an open book. In a soft, soothing voice, the hedgehog unravels the mysteries of the subconscious, each word drifting through the air like a warm, heavy blanket. Gradually, the boundaries of reality and dream dissolve, and as the scene fades to black, you feel yourself slipping into the depths of these imagined worlds.

As you navigate these dreams, you’ll confront the limitations of imagination, wrestle with the weight of expectation, and uncover hidden depths within the seemingly ordinary. This journey is more than a series of battles; it is a glimpse into the creative process, a celebration of perseverance, and a reminder—for me and for all—that even in moments of burnout, stories are still waiting to be told.

# About

this will be a code dump for a campaign for [Hedgewars](https://www.hedgewars.org/) to showcase the potential of this game, and my capabilities

you're mainly interested in Missions/Campaign/A_Collection_of_Unimaginative_Dreams and Maps, as Missions/Training and Scripts/Multiplayer are tech demos of individual functions without any instructions
