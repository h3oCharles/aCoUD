A Collection of Unimaginative Dreams

this will be a code dump for a campaign for [Hedgewars](https://www.hedgewars.org/) to showcase the potential of this game

to make it work in-game, download the code as a ZIP file, and rename the extension to HWP and [put it in your data folder](https://www.hedgewars.org/node/6761)

if anyone would like to contribute, please read [the knowledge base](https://www.hedgewars.org/kb/LuaAPI) first before contacting me
