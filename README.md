# aCoUD
A Collection of Unimaginative Dreams

this will be a code dump for a campaign for [Hedgewars](https://www.hedgewars.org/) to showcase the potential of this game

to make it work in-game, download the code, extract it to reveal a "aCoUD-main" folder, open it, select all contents (which should be a "Missions" folder, a "Scripts" folder, README and LICENSE) and package it as a ZIP file, and rename the extension to HWP and [put it in your data folder](https://www.hedgewars.org/node/6761)

if anyone would like to contribute, please read [the knowledge base](https://www.hedgewars.org/kb/LuaAPI) first before contacting me
