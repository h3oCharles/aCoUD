# A Collection of Unimaginative Dreams

this will be a code dump for a campaign for [Hedgewars](https://www.hedgewars.org/) to showcase the potential of this game, and my own capabilities

# Installation

to make it work in-game, download the code as a ZIP file and extract it to reveal an "aCoUD-main" folder. Open it, select all contents (which should be a "Missions" folder, a "Scripts" folder, a "Maps" folder, README, and LICENSE), package it as a ZIP file, and rename the extension to HWP and [put it in your data folder](https://www.hedgewars.org/node/6761)

# Contribute
